I would like to thank all the people that helped and contributed to this thesis. I want to express my gratitude to Hanna Sch√§fer and Georg Groh. They gave me the opportunity to work on this amazing topic and write my bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Applied Informatics. The weekly meetings gave me the motivation, feedback and advice needed to complete this thesis. Thanks for providing me with two servers for my experiments and all the fulfilled requests that I constantly issued.
